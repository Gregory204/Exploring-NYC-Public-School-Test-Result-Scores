# What is this about?
This is based off of test scores from American high school students who take the SATs.
It is meant to measure the skills students have with math, reading, and writing. It also
is a project that helps parents consider on what school to send their kids because of the
more prepared the kids would feel to take SATs just by the parents looking at the data given
to them.

# How?
Made with python and used pandas to read in the data.
